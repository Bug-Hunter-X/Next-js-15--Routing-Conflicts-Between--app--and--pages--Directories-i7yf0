This repository demonstrates a potential conflict in Next.js 15 when using both the new `app` directory and the legacy `pages` directory.  The example showcases routing conflicts when routes defined in both directories overlap.  The `pages` directory contains a legacy `about.js` page, while the `app` directory also contains an `about` route in `app/about/page.js`. This setup can cause unexpected routing behavior depending on the request path. Inconsistent data fetching methods across the directories can also create unexpected situations. This repository aims to provide a clear and concise explanation of the issue and a possible solution.
