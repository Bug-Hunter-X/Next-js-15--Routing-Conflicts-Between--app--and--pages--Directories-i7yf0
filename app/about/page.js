In Next.js 15, a potential issue can arise when using the `app` directory's new features alongside legacy `pages` directory components.  If a route defined in `app` clashes with one in `pages`, Next.js might not handle the conflict as expected.  For instance, if you have both `pages/about.js` and `app/about/page.js`, unpredictable routing behavior could occur, potentially leading to the wrong component rendering or errors.  Another issue could be related to data fetching using `getServerSideProps` or similar methods. If these are used inconsistently between `app` and `pages` components for the same route, data inconsistencies can lead to unexpected behavior.
