The most straightforward solution is to consolidate all routes either into the `app` directory (recommended for new projects) or to completely remove the `pages` directory and migrate all its contents to the `app` directory. If migrating is not possible in the short term, carefully examine all the routes in both directories and ensure there are no conflicting paths. Refactor conflicting routes, prioritizing the `app` directory routes if possible. For data fetching, strictly adopt a single data fetching approach for all routes and avoid mixing `getServerSideProps` in `pages` with `async function` fetching in `app`.  Always maintain consistency in your data-fetching methods to avoid unexpected runtime issues.
